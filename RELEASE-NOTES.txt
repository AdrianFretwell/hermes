- Remove conf folder from Ebms plugin.

========================================
Jun 13, 2007

- Remove default proxy server settings (corvus.properties.xml)
- Disable default compression for AS2 receiver (plugin.xml)
- Fix bug that unable to define the customized module class when invocating hk.hku.cecid.piazza.commons.module.ModuleGroup#loadModules
- Add new ActiveModule - MessageMonitor has been added to EbMS to manage message timeout. It involves following changes.
- Add new column "timeout_time_stamp" in EbMS message table and update associated DAOMessage.xml.
- Refactored / Updated the MessageDAO, MessageDVO, MessageDatasSourceDAO, MessageDataSourceDVO for DB schema synchronization.
- Added a DAO update query called "updatedTimedOutMessageStatus" to resend all timed-out message.
- Added a new ActiveModule called "MessageMonitor" which updates the status of timed-out messages to PENDING periodically.
- Refactor / Updated OutboxTask for the support of new Timeout mechanism. The thread terminates itself after attempting to deliver (no matter success or fail). Then it will try to resend the message after timeout. If it has already reached the number of retired allowed, marks the delivery status as fail.
- Refactor / Updated IncomingMessageProcessor at processing acknowledgment module. It now updates the status of the order message corresponding to the ACK to final status (DF, PS,) and clear the message in the outbox queue.
- Update Loopback test to use SAAJ model instead of AXIS and support JDK1.5.
